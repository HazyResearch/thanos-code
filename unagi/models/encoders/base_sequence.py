    """Abstract sequence model class. All layers that the backbones
    use must adhere to this

    A sequence model is a layer that transforms an input of shape
    (n_batch, l_sequence, d_input) to (n_batch, l_sequence, d_output)
    Additionally, it returns a "state" which can be any additional information
    For example, RNN and SSM layers may return their hidden state,
    while some types of transformer layers (e.g. Transformer-XL) may want to pass
    through state as well
    - default_state receives a batch_shape with device and returns an initial state
    - step simulates a single step of the sequence (e.g. one unroll for an RNN).
       It receives a state and single input (n_batch, d_input) and returns a state
       and output (n_batch, d_output)
    - forward is a sequence-to-sequence transformation that receives an optional state
